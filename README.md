# Linked-List-
Welcome to the Linked List Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions repository!This project is a collection of linked list-related problems, algorithms, and data structure implementations.
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. They are widely used in various applications, including dynamic memory allocation, graph representations, and implementing other data structures like queues and stacks.
This repository provides a collection of linked list problems and their solutions. By solving these problems, you'll improve your understanding of linked list operations and how to apply them to solve complex algorithmic challenges.

Questions & Solutions

The repository includes a variety of problems related to linked lists, such as:

    Basic Operations:
        Insertion (at the beginning, middle, end)
        Deletion (from the beginning, middle, end)
        Traversal
        Searching
    Reversal:
        Reversing a singly linked list
        Reversing in groups
    Cycle Detection:
        Detecting a cycle in a linked list (Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm)
    Merge and Sorting:
        Merging two sorted linked lists
        Sorting a linked list (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    Intersection and Duplication:
        Finding the intersection of two linked lists
        Removing duplicates from a linked list
    Palindrome Check:
        Checking if a linked list is a palindrome
    Length and Middle:
        Finding the length of a linked list
        Finding the middle element of a linked list
    K-th Node:
        Finding the K-th node from the end of a linked list
    Flattening a Linked List:
        Flattening a multi-level linked list into a single-level linked list

Each problem has a detailed explanation of the approach and an efficient solution in C++.
